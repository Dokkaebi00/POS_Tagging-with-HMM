# ABANDONED 
## This is just a remind myself what to do next 

### Dataset preparation: 
   * [ ] Create dataset 60-70 sentences (Test model on this dataset) 

### Re-train Stanza: 
* [x] Custom mapping from dataset to CoNLL-U format (Data conversion) 
* [ ] Read training guide for Stanza and list what to prepare   
  * [ ] Export CoNLL-U file (*.conllu) 
  * [ ] [Prepare Word Vector Data](https://stanfordnlp.github.io/stanza/training.html), I am not really sure should do this... 
  * [ ] List here  

### Evaluation guideline: 
   * [ ] Create Gold dataset (Test model on this dataset) **(OPTIONAL)**  
   * [ ] Compare HMM Algorithm with Viterbi decode vs. Stanza pretrained model  
   * [ ] Compare HMM + Viterbi with re-train Stanza on custom dataset   
   * [ ] List here
